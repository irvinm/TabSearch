# TabSearch

## Inspiration
- As a power user of Tree Style Tab (TST) and a user usually with large sessions with many tabs, I wanted to create a unique experience primarily focused on vertical tab solutions utilitzing Firefox's native ability to hide tabs.  When doing searches, tabs that do not meet your search criteria will be hidden until you find the tab you want or cancel the search.  Tabs are only hidden temporarily and never permanently.  This addon works independantly of vertical tab solutions and will work for everyone.
  
## Features

### Core Search

- Search open tabs by URL, title, or page content (text inside loaded tabs).
- Hide all non-matching tabs for a focused search experience.
- Tab hiding is temporary: all tabs are restored when the search is cleared or the popup is closed.
- Never hides pinned or active tabs.

### Search Behavior

- Supports real-time search (filter as you type) or manual search (on submit).
- Hides and shows tabs across all browser windows for comprehensive search.
    - The active tab in each window always remains visible, as it cannot be hidden.
- If search-affecting options are changed mid-search, the active search is cleared and tabs are restored to their pre-search state.
    - Search-affecting options are: Search URLs, Search tab titles, Search contents of loaded tabs, Real-time search, Support for Tree Style Tab (TST), and Auto-expand trees with matched tabs.
    - "Select all matching tabs on close" and "Disable initial hide action" do not interrupt an in-progress search.

### Keyboard and Productivity

- Keyboard shortcut to open the search dialog.
    - Customizable via about:addons -> gear -> Manage Extension Shortcuts.
- Audio tab search: quickly find and focus tabs playing audio.
- Option to multi-select matching tabs after search is complete.
    - "Select all matching tabs on close" only applies when the search session ends.
- Shows the number of remaining tabs to be hidden/shown on the addon icon.

### Tree Style Tab (Optional)

- Optional support for Tree Style Tab (TST).
- TST search results are visually flattened during a search for faster scanning.
    - Matching tabs are left-aligned and rendered with symmetric horizontal spacing while the search is active.
    - The original tree structure is restored after the search ends.
- Optional auto-expand behavior for matched tabs in close-time multi-select flows.
    - The "Auto-expand trees with matched tabs" option is shown only when TST support is enabled.

### Permission Initialization

- Option to disable the initial tab-hiding action (once the privacy dialog is accepted).
    - The addon briefly hides and shows the last tab on startup to trigger Firefox's tab-hiding permission prompt.
    - Once permission is granted, you can disable this startup initialization step.


## Search Dialog Behavior

- Opening the popup starts a search session scoped to the current state of visible/hidden tabs.
- While searching, changing some options will clear the search input and restore tabs to their pre-search state so results stay consistent.

### Options That Reset an Active Search

- Search URLs
- Search tab titles
- Search contents of loaded tabs
- Real-time search
- Support for Tree Style Tab (TST)
- Auto-expand trees with matched tabs

### Options That Do Not Reset an Active Search

- Select all matching tabs on close
- Disable initial hide action

### Notes

- "Select all matching tabs on close" applies when the search session ends; it does not change in-progress filtering.
- "Disable initial hide action" only affects the startup permission initialization step; it does not change matching/filtering during a search.
- "Auto-expand trees with matched tabs" is only shown when TST support is enabled.
- Clicking either blue info button cancels any active search, restores tab visibility/state, opens the help page in a new active tab, and closes the popup.


## Limitations

- Content search only works on loaded, regular web pages (not special pages like about:blank or browser settings).
    - Tabs that are unloaded (discarded) cannot be searched until loaded.
- Search is case-insensitive and uses simple substring matching (not true fuzzy search).
- Hiding or unhiding a large number of tabs may be slow, especially with many open tabs.
- Uses the `tabs.hide()` API, which requires explicit user permission and may show a privacy dialog on first use.

    - [Mozilla Bugzilla Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1964491)
- Opening the search dialog should select the search input field by default, but a Firefox bug may require you to click the input field manually.
    - [Mozilla Discourse Discussion](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/use-of-autofocus-in-popup-html-not-consistent/143017/2)
    - [Mozilla Bugzilla Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1877410)
- Tab content search requires at least 3 characters in the search term.
- When "Select all matching tabs on close" is enabled with multiple open windows, there is a Firefox limitation that dragging tabs has to be done PER window.


## Known Issues

- Initial use will trigger a Firefox privacy dialog about tab hiding (expected behavior).
    - If permission is not granted, the dialog may reappear and cause UI conflicts.
- No fuzzy matching or typo tolerance (feature possibly planned).
- Performance may degrade with very large tab sets.
- Real-time searching may be slow on older or slower machines.
- Does not detect if another extension is also using the `tabs.hide()` API (may cause conflicts).
- Some features (like content search) may not work on all tab types.
