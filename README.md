# TabSearch

## Inspiration
- As a power user of Tree Style Tab (TST) and a user usually with large sessions with many tabs, I wanted to create a unique experience primarily focused on vertical tab solutions utilitzing Firefox's native ability to hide tabs.  When doing searches, tabs that do not meet your search criteria will be hidden until you find the tab you want or cancel the search.  Tabs are only hidden temporarily and never permanently.  This addon works independantly of vertical tab solutions and will work for everyone.
  
## Features

### Core Search

- Search open tabs by URL, title, or page content (text inside loaded tabs).
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Powered by Fuse.js v7.3.0 with Token Search for superior multi-word matching (e.g., "Mail Google" finds "Google Mail") and a configurable threshold slider (0.0 to 1.0).
- Hide all non-matching tabs for a focused search experience.
- Tab hiding is temporary: all tabs are restored when the search is cleared or the popup is closed.
- Never hides pinned or active tabs.

### Search Behavior

- Supports real-time search (filter as you type) or manual search (on submit).
- Hides and shows tabs across all browser windows for comprehensive search.
    - The active tab in each window always remains visible, as it cannot be hidden.
- If search-affecting options are changed mid-search, the active search is cleared and tabs are restored to their pre-search state.
    - Search-affecting options are: Search URLs, Search tab titles, Search contents of loaded tabs, Virtual search results dashboard, Real-time search, Fuzzy matching, Support for Tree Style Tab (TST), and Auto-expand trees with matched tabs.
    - "Select all matching tabs on close" and "Disable initial hide action" do not interrupt an in-progress search.

### Keyboard and Productivity

- Keyboard shortcut to open the search dialog.
    - Customizable via about:addons -> gear -> Manage Extension Shortcuts.
- Audio tab search: quickly find and focus tabs playing audio.
- Option to multi-select matching tabs after search is complete.
    - "Select all matching tabs on close" only applies when the search session ends.
- Shows the number of remaining tabs to be hidden/shown on the addon icon.

### Virtual Search Results Dashboard

- Option to switch from traditional tab-hiding to a dedicated, consolidated search dashboard tab.
- Groups matching tabs by browser window with the active window listed first.
- Direct inline search refinement and real-time filtering without re-opening the popup.
- Interactive collapse/expand controls per window section with saved state.
- Keyboard navigation (Arrow Up/Down, Enter) to jump directly to target tabs across any window.
- Smart auto-close: automatically closes the dashboard tab when switching away to another tab or changing window focus (configurable via "Keep dashboard open after selecting a tab").
- Real-time tab lifecycle synchronization (updates dynamically when tabs are opened, closed, navigated, or moved).
- Native Firefox and Web Favicons:
    - Displays the authentic, full-color Firefox logo for native browser tabs (`about:blank`, `about:newtab`, `about:home`, `about:welcome`).
    - Dedicated Mozilla Photon SVG icons for protected internal pages (`about:addons`, `about:preferences`, `about:config`, `about:downloads`, `about:history`, `about:bookmarks`, `about:debugging`, `about:support`).
    - Neutral Firefox globe fallback for web pages without a favicon.
    - Adaptive light/dark theme support for all embedded SVGs.

### Tree Style Tab (Optional)

- Optional support for Tree Style Tab (TST).
- TST search results are visually flattened during a search for faster scanning.
    - Matching tabs are left-aligned and rendered with symmetric horizontal spacing while the search is active.
    - The original tree structure is restored after the search ends.
- Optional auto-expand behavior for matched tabs in close-time multi-select flows.
    - The "Auto-expand trees with matched tabs" option is shown only when TST support is enabled.

### Permission Initialization

- One-time onboarding setup: On the first click of the addon icon after installation, TabSearch displays a welcome view with guidance on Firefox's native tab-hiding permission requirement.
- Option to disable the initial tab-hiding action (once the permission dialog has been granted).
    - The addon uses a temporary background tab to trigger Firefox's tab-hiding permission prompt without disturbing or shifting existing user tabs.
    - Once permission is granted, you can disable this initialization step.


## Search Dialog Behavior

- Opening the popup starts a search session scoped to the current state of visible/hidden tabs.
- While searching, changing some options will clear the search input and restore tabs to their pre-search state so results stay consistent.

### Options That Reset an Active Search

- Search URLs
- Search tab titles
- Search contents of loaded tabs
- Virtual search results dashboard
- Real-time search
- Fuzzy matching (titles & URLs)
- Support for Tree Style Tab (TST)
- Auto-expand trees with matched tabs

### Options That Do Not Reset an Active Search

- Select all matching tabs on close
- Disable initial hide action

### Notes

- "Select all matching tabs on close" applies when the search session ends; it does not change in-progress filtering.
- "Disable initial hide action" only affects the startup permission initialization step; it does not change matching/filtering during a search.
- "Auto-expand trees with matched tabs" is only shown when TST support is enabled.
- Clicking either blue info button cancels any active search, restores tab visibility/state, opens the help page in a new active tab, and closes the popup.


## Limitations

- Content search only works on loaded, regular web pages (not special pages like about:blank or browser settings).
    - Tabs that are unloaded (discarded) cannot be searched until loaded.
- Search is case-insensitive. Standard search uses substring matching, while Fuzzy Matching uses Fuse.js.
- Hiding or unhiding a large number of tabs may be slow, especially with many open tabs.
- Uses the `tabs.hide()` API, which requires explicit user permission and may show a privacy dialog on first use.
    - [Mozilla Discourse Discussion](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/initial-tabs-hide-warning-dialog/142979/4)
    - [Mozilla Bugzilla Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1964491)
- Opening the search dialog should select the search input field by default, but a Firefox bug may require you to click the input field manually.
    - [Mozilla Discourse Discussion](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/use-of-autofocus-in-popup-html-not-consistent/143017/2)
    - [Mozilla Bugzilla Report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1877410)
- Tab content search requires at least 3 characters in the search term.
- When "Select all matching tabs on close" is enabled with multiple open windows, there is a Firefox limitation that dragging tabs has to be done PER window.


## Known Issues

- Initial use will trigger a Firefox privacy dialog about tab hiding (expected behavior).
    - If permission is not granted, the dialog may reappear and cause UI conflicts.

- Performance may degrade with very large tab sets.
- Real-time searching may be slow on older or slower machines.
- Does not detect if another extension is also using the `tabs.hide()` API (may cause conflicts).
- Some features (like content search) may not work on all tab types.

## Changelog

<details open>
<summary><strong>v0.8.0.2 (2026-09-22) - Virtual Search Results Dashboard, Permission Streamlining & MV3 TST Resilience</strong></summary>

### Major Highlights

1. **Virtual Search Results Dashboard**:
   - A high-performance alternative to traditional tab-hiding, designed specifically for older or resource-constrained machines and heavy multi-window browsing sessions. Consolidates all matching tabs across all windows into a single, clean dashboard tab without triggering mass tab strip reflows.
2. **New Post-Install Onboarding & Permission Flow**:
   - A redesigned, elegant first-run experience to help Firefox grant the native `tabHide` permission. Rather than triggering tab-hiding unexpectedly on install, TabSearch displays an onboarding guide in the popup on first click, clearly explaining the Firefox permission requirement and instructing users to choose "Keep tabs hidden" before safely invoking the permission prompt.
3. **Permission Streamlining & Least Privilege Security**:
   - Eliminated unused `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]` from `manifest.json`. This stops Firefox from showing the persistent green attention dot under the toolbar icon on startup, eliminates unnecessary optional permission warnings ("Access your data for all websites" and "Access local files on your computer") in `about:addons`, and ensures TabSearch strictly requests only the minimal permissions required (`tabs`, `tabHide`, `storage`, `find`).
4. **TST Tree Visibility & State Restoration Resilience (Manifest V3 Lifecycle Fixes)**:
   - Fixed two lingering issues with Tree Style Tab (TST) integration where tree visibility and expanded/collapsed branch states were occasionally lost or corrupted. Because Manifest V3 aggressively unloads background scripts after 30 seconds of inactivity, TST hierarchy snapshots and search locks are now persisted directly into local storage for seamless state rehydration, backed by an active popup-lifecycle heartbeat to eliminate race conditions.

---

### Detailed Breakdown

#### 1. Virtual Search Results Dashboard Mode
- **Singleton Dashboard Tab**: Added dedicated search dashboard page (`search-results.html`) consolidating search results across all browser windows into one organized tab.
- **Window Grouping & Priority**: Multi-window results are grouped by window, with the currently active window pinned first and remaining windows sorted by ID.
- **Inline Query Refinement**: Live query input and search scope toggles (URLs, titles, page contents, fuzzy threshold) directly inside the dashboard.
- **Collapsible Window Sections**: Interactive per-window accordion controls with persistent collapsed/expanded state.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard traversal (Arrow Up, Arrow Down, Enter) that automatically skips collapsed windows and jumps directly to the highlighted tab.
- **Window Restoration on Jump**: Selecting a tab automatically un-minimizes/restores and focuses background windows.
- **Window Badges & Match Summary**: Real-time matching tab count badges on window headers and total matches summary counter.
- **Configurable Auto-Close**: Option to automatically close the dashboard tab when switching away to another tab or defocusing the window ("Keep dashboard open after selecting a tab").
- **Live Tab Lifecycle Sync**: Dynamic updates as tabs are created, updated, removed, moved, attached, or detached across windows.
- **Authentic Firefox & Photon Branding**: Full-color Firefox logos for `about:blank`/`about:newtab`, dedicated Mozilla Photon SVGs for internal pages (`about:addons`, `about:preferences`, etc.), and clean globe fallbacks.
- **Popup Synchronization**: Popup automatically disables and grays out non-applicable tab-hiding options when Virtual Dashboard mode is active.

#### 2. Post-Install Onboarding & Permission Workflow
- **First-Run Welcome Screen**: Clean intro screen in `popup.html` presented only upon first opening the popup after installation.
- **Permission Guidance**: Clear explanation of Firefox's native tab-hiding permission requirement with explicit instructions on clicking "Keep tabs hidden".
- **Non-Disruptive Triggering**: Uses a temporary background tab to safely invoke Firefox's native permission doorhanger without shifting or disturbing the user's active browsing tabs.
- **Deferred Execution**: Zero intrusive prompts during initial addon installation; triggers only when the user deliberately opens TabSearch for the first time.

#### 3. Permission Streamlining & Least Privilege Security
- **Eliminated Unused Host Permissions**: Removed `host_permissions: ["<all_urls>"]` from `manifest.json`.
- **Eliminated Attention Dot & Optional Prompts**: Stops Firefox from displaying the green attention dot under the extension toolbar icon on startup and eliminates optional permission prompts in `about:addons`.
- **Updated Privacy Guarantees**: Updated `privacy.html` documentation to explicitly guarantee zero host, website, or local file access.
- **Manifest Integrity Tests**: Added automated unit test suite (`tests/manifest.test.js`) verifying strict minimal permissions and version synchronization between `package.json` and `manifest.json`.

#### 4. Tree Style Tab (TST) Resilience & Manifest V3 Hardening
- **Storage-Backed State Rehydration**: Serializes pre-search TST tree snapshots and active search locks to `browser.storage.local`, ensuring tree structures can be restored even if the background page is terminated by Firefox's 30-second MV3 idle timer.
- **Popup-Lifecycle Port Heartbeat**: Maintains an active communication port between popup and background scripts during search sessions to prevent premature background script suspension.
- **Search Queue & Lock Guarding**: Intercepts rapid keyboard input to process searches sequentially and avoids snapshot overwriting during rapid popup open/close transitions.
- **Restoration Grace Window**: Added delayed restoration safeguards to handle out-of-order Firefox tab activation events when closing the search popup.

#### 5. Search Defaults & Performance
- **Content Search Default**: Default search scope set to URL and title only (`searchContents: false`), dramatically speeding up searches across large tab sets while allowing users to opt into deep page-content searches when needed.
- **Fuzzy Search Threshold Tuning**: Fine-tuned default threshold for Fuse.js token matching to maximize relevant matches while minimizing noise.

<summary><strong>v0.7.1 (2026-07-04) - TST State Restoration Hardening and Permission Verification</strong></summary>

- **Tab Hide Permission Verification UI/UX**:
    - Added a user-friendly permission warning banner (`.permission-banner` with interactive controls) to `popup.html` when the `tabHide` browser permission is not yet active/confirmed.
    - Prompts the user to trigger the Firefox native permission doorhanger and guides them to choose "Keep" (allow).
    - **Deferred Verification**: Triggered only upon the first time the user opens the extension popup (clicking the addon icon) rather than at installation or startup, ensuring a non-intrusive install experience.
    - Integrates background verification check (`check-tabhide-permission` action) that programmatically verifies permission status using a temporary tab.
- **TST State Restoration Hardening** (mitigating [Issue #13](https://github.com/irvinm/TabSearch/issues/13) race conditions):
    - **State Locking (`snapshotInProgress`)**: Added module-level lock to ensure atomic TST state capture and prevent overwriting clean snapshots.
    - **Persistence Tracking (`originalTSTTreeSnapshotTaken`)**: Tracks pre-search tree states to prevent trying to restore un-snapshotted states.
    - **Error Boundaries (`try...finally`)**: Wrapped all main TST orchestration blocks to guarantee state tracking resets even on communication failures.
    - **Delayed Restoration & Activation Grace Window**: Handles Firefox out-of-order events upon popup close and preserves branch expansion for the newly activated tab.
    - **Search Operation Queue (`pendingSearchMsg`)**: Intercepts and queues rapid keyboard input to ensure search operations run sequentially and cleanly.
    - **Empty Search Term Restoration**: Triggers immediate restoration of tree states when the search input is cleared/emptied, even if the popup remains open.
    - **Awaiting Active Searches on Reset/Close**: Cancels pending search requests and awaits active search completion with a 5-second timeout safeguard to eliminate race conditions.
